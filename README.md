For this milestone my main hurdle was gathering data.  In order to get this data, I need participants to go into their settings and request a download from Instagram then send it to me.  I also need them to self-report their age, gender identity, and sexuality, as these are data that I cannot just determine myself.

Once I gained enough data, I started messing around with the data. First I loaded about 6 of my files into a workbook (why 6? I don't know, I just liked how it ended on '5' beginning from '0').  I looked around at some of the data and found that for some reason some Author value was just not included so I had to find a way to make new dataframes out of them while skipping over these values. This was the only code cell [11] in which I needed to use Google Gemini to help me figure it out. After that, I made them all into one dataframe by combining the advertiser name, along with the users self reported demographics and a user ID. After a little research, I found a method called .nunique() which counts the number of unique properties. For me, this came in handy when grouping these by advertiser, I could find the number of unique users each advertiser showed up on.  This is where I'll begin next week as I determine the type of data visualization likely using advertisers that show up for more than one user.
